# Parallel_Muti_Threaded_Cient_Server_Chat_System
In This project model we have tried the implementation of a small chat client server model that sets the server over the host and enables various clients to connect to and share messages. Users can connect using the requested client server connection to the main server and after the connection allows the user to share messages. The project uses the concepts of multi-threading and the server uses a different thread at the request of each client. Thus, it makes data connection over a one client which was not possible before due to lack of multiple threads. As this is the internet age and interacting with chat is very important part of the day-to-day communication.
